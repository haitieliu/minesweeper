## Introduction

In this project, I developed an interactive Minesweeper game using Python and the Pygame library. The game not only allows users to play Minesweeper with a graphical interface but also features an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent capable of making moves based on logical deductions.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **Pygame**: A Python library used for game development, providing the tools necessary for rendering graphics, handling events, and more.
- **Minesweeper and AI Logic**: Custom Python classes to handle the game logic and AI decision-making.

## Game Features

- **Standard Minesweeper Gameplay**: Users can click to reveal cells and right-click to place flags on cells where they suspect mines are located.
- **AI Integration**: At any point during the game, players can invoke an AI agent to make a safe move or a random move if no obvious safe moves are available.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: The game's grid size and the number of mines can be adjusted to change the difficulty level.
- **Graphical Interface**: The game presents a visually appealing interface with clear indications of mines, flags, and numbers indicating nearby mines.

## Development Process

1. **Setting Up Pygame**: The first step involved setting up Pygame and creating a basic window where the game would be played.
2. **Designing the Game Board**: I defined the game board using a grid system. Each cell in the grid could either contain a mine or a number indicating the count of adjacent mines.
3. **Implementing Game Logic**: The core logic of Minesweeper, including mine placement and game rules (revealing cells, game win/loss conditions), was implemented.
4. **AI Agent Development**: I developed an AI agent using logical reasoning. The AI uses knowledge about safe and mined cells to make informed decisions.
5. **User Interface Design**: I added a user-friendly interface, including buttons for user interactions like resetting the game or asking the AI for help.
6. **Testing and Refinement**: The final stage involved thorough testing and refining the game's mechanics and AI's decision-making process.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **AI Implementation**: Developing an AI agent that makes decisions based on the current state of the game was challenging and required a good understanding of logical deduction and Minesweeper's rules.
- **Pygame Mechanics**: Learning and effectively using Pygame for rendering the game's interface was a key part of the project.

## Conclusion

This project was a rewarding experience that combined game development with artificial intelligence. It not only solidified my skills in Python programming but also in applying logical problem-solving to create an intelligent game agent.
